Hi! My name is Gabriel Tan-Chen. I am a software developer at the Centre for International Governance Innovation.

Growing up in Oakville, Ontario, I was blessed to have the opportunity to attend King's Christian Collegiate. There I discovered my affinity for math, and afterwards decided to pursue a degree in International Economics & Finance. After a few semesters, I realized I did not find the same level of passion in economics, and after some soul searching I landed in the computer science program at the University of Toronto.

It was at U of T that I realized my love for math was actually a love for problem solving, and tackled the complex problems of theoretical computer science with much vigour. What I really loved, however, was building products. After graduating, I worked as a consultant in Toronto, Ontario, building enterprise software solutions for various stakeholders.

When my wife started her graduate studies to pursue her PhD at the University of Waterloo, we moved to Waterloo and I worked for a startup in Waterloo's Accelerator Centre. There I helped build a high-traffic digital marketplace that operated in the United Kingdom.

A bonus to moving to Waterloo is having closer access to Ontario's amazing countryside. As an avid triathlete, I can usually be found cycling and running on our region's rural roads, frequently stopping for ice cream and coffee breaks in Stratford or Elora.

I now work at the Centre for International Governance Innovation, a think tank committed to making a difference through research on global public policy. After all, as great as programming can be, it is only a means to attempt what others deem impossible feats. That should be the goal of every line of code - change the world, even by a slightest fraction. Stay hungry, stay foolish.
