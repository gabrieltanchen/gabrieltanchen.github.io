Hi! My name is Gabriel Tan-Chen, and I am a software developer at the Centre for International Governance Innovation.

I have a love affair with problem solving, so it was only a matter of time before I started programming. I live my life not by a code, but by code, often obsessing over a project day and night until it is finished. Languages through which I manipulate transistors include C, C++, Javascript, and Python.

As great as programming can be, it is only a means to attempt what others deem impossible feats. That should be the goal of every line of code - change the world, even by a slightest fraction. Stay hungry, stay foolish.
