Hi! My name is Gabriel Tan-Chen. I am a software developer at the Centre for International Governance Innovation.

I have an affinity for problem solving, so it was only a matter of time before I started programming. I live my life not by a code, but by code, often obsessing over a project day and night until it is finished.

When I am away from my computer, I can be found cycling or running on Waterloo Region's rural country roads. frequently stopping for ice cream breaks in Stratford or Elora.
