title:  "Hello, World!"

Welcome to a new year, a fresh start, and this blog. My name is Gabriel, though many call me Gabe, and my very life seems to be a paradox. I am a computer science student excited about the possibilities of the future, yet find that technology often than not feels cold and distant. I'm a photographer that still shoots film, such as the image above. Why, you ask? Digital photography lacks the intimacy and excitement of, for example, poring over recently developed negatives.

Technology can certainly create excitement, but it seems to be more [terrifying](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFrjrgBV8K0) than exhilarating. There are steps however, that make computers infinitely more personal. I am still astounded when I encounter websites featuring parallax scrolling. That's exactly what I'm searching for - methods to create a more relational experience with the quindecillion bits that surround us.
