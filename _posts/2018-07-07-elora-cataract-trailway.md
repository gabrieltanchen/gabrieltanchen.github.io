I had been planning on cycling the entire Elora Cataract Trailway for some time. Having run/biked on small sections of it, I wanted to explore all 50km of trail. My main concern for doing that distance was not having an appropriate bike.

On previous bike rides on the trailway I had used my mountain bike, which was probably overkill for the relatively smooth trail. I did not want to use that bike for this ride, because cycling from my house to the trailway, riding the trailway, and coming back home is a 170km journey.

I tried outfitting my road bike with wider tires to handle the gravel roads, but even 25mm tires would rub the top of the fork on my 2014 Cervelo R3. I was a little worried about doing that distance on 23mm tires that I’d have to pump up to over 100psi to avoid any pinch flats. In the end I figured it was worth a try on the trailway, and I could always turn around to make the ride simply a nice trip to Elora.

Today was a beautiful day to do the ride. We’ve had a heat wave for the past week, with temperatures feeling like over 40 degrees Celsius. The temperature broke a couple days ago, and today felt cool at 25 degrees. The sky was so blue it looked fake, as if I was in a movie.

In the end, all my anticipation for riding my road bike on the trailway was for naught. The bike can handle a lot even with 23mm tires, and I had an absolute blast on the trailway. It was nice being off the road and not worrying about cars, which were more aggressive than usual today while cycling to Elora. I’ll definitely be back to ride the Elora Cataract Trailway again, but maybe I’ll drive to Elora to skip the road section of the route.

I’d like to ride the Cambridge to Paris Rail Trail on my road bike next. Hopefully I’ll have another free weekend soon.
